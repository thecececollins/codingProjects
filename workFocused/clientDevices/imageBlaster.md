### This is no longer in use due to DeployStudio -> Imagr -> DEP

## Tips for getting the Imager Blaster script to run:

- Use -h to get help
- Put the script in a directory with .dmg files that you want to "blast" to a tools HD
- Format the tools HD with a partition named "ToolsTarget" or use a preveously imaged tools disk with a partition named "Extra Storage"
- Run the script 
	`./ImageBlaster.sh`

- Follow the prompts

- The images will be put in the order they appear in the finder (like below)
- Images that need larger partitions can be hinted like the snow leopard kg image in the picture below,  see the help for more info.
